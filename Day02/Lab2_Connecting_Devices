# Day 2 â€“ Intermediate Networking Lab

# Objective
Practice connecting multiple LANs with routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, and servers using correct cabling (considering Auto MDI-X disabled).

# Topology
Routers: 4
Switches: 8
PCs: 3
Servers: 1

# Steps
Added routers, switches, PCs, firewalls, and servers in Packet Tracer.
Connected devices using appropriate cables (straight-through, crossover, fiber where required).
NOTE: Packet Tracer doesn't differentiate between single-mode and multimode fiber, but think about which one is appropriate when you use a fiber connection.
For switches connected to each other, used crossover cable.
Tested connectivity with ping between devices across different LANs.

# Result

All devices in LAN1 and LAN2 communicated successfully through the routers.

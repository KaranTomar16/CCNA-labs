# Day 11 – Static Routing Lab

# Objective
Configure PCs and routers with correct IP addresses and gateways, then set up static routes on routers to allow communication between two PCs across multiple routers.

# Topology

PCs: 2
Routers: 3
Switches: 2

# IP Assignments:

PC1: 192.168.1.1/24, Gateway 192.168.1.254
R1 (G0/1): 192.168.1.254/24
R1 (G0/0): 192.168.12.1/24
R2 (G0/0): 192.168.12.2/24
R2 (G0/1): 192.168.13.2/24
R3 (G0/0): 192.168.13.3/24
R3 (G0/1): 192.168.3.254/24
PC2: 192.168.3.1/24, Gateway 192.168.3.254

# Steps

Configured hostnames and IP addresses on PCs and routers.
Set default gateways on PCs.
Configured static routes:
On R1: ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
On R2: ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1 and ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3

On R3: ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2
Verified static routes with show ip route.
Tested end-to-end connectivity using ping from PC1 to PC2.

# Result

PC1 successfully pinged PC2 through R1 → R2 → R3 using static routing. All devices communicated as expected.

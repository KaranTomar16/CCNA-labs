# Day 11 – Static Routing Troubleshooting Lab

# Objective
Identify and fix misconfigurations on routers to enable successful communication between PC1 and PC2 across multiple routers.

# Topology
PCs: 2
Routers: 3
Switches: 2
IP Assignments (after correction):
PC1: 192.168.1.1/24, Gateway 192.168.1.254
R1 (G0/1): 192.168.1.254/24
R1 (G0/0): 192.168.12.1/24
R2 (G0/0): 192.168.12.2/24
R2 (G0/1): 192.168.13.2/24
R3 (G0/0): 192.168.13.3/24
R3 (G0/1): 192.168.3.254/24
PC2: 192.168.3.1/24, Gateway 192.168.3.254

# Steps

Configured hostnames, IP addresses, and gateways on PCs and routers.
Initial ping between PC1 and PC2 failed.
Troubleshot configuration and found issues:
R1: Static route misconfigured. Corrected route:
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2

R2: Wrong IP address on interface. Corrected to:
G0/0 → 192.168.12.2/24
G0/1 → 192.168.13.2/24

R3: Wrong IP address on interface. Corrected to:
G0/0 → 192.168.13.3/24
G0/1 → 192.168.3.254/24

Verified routing tables with show ip route.
Retested connectivity with ping between PC1 and PC2.

# Result

After correcting the static route on R1 and IP addressing errors on R2 and R3, PC1 successfully pinged PC2. The lab was completed successfull

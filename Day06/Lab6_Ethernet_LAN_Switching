# Day 6 – Ethernet LAN Switching Part-II

# Objective
Analyze ARP and MAC learning on switches, observe how MAC address tables are populated, and practice clearing dynamic entries.

# Topology
Switches: 2
PCs: 4

# Steps
Initial State
Both switches had empty MAC address tables.
All PCs had empty ARP tables.
Ping from PC1 → PC3
PC1 broadcasted an ARP request to learn PC3’s MAC.
Switch flooded the frame to all ports.
PC3 replied with its MAC address.
Switch learned the MAC addresses of PC1 and PC3.
Ping from PC2 → PC4
Similar process: ARP request broadcasted, switch flooded it.
PC4 replied with its MAC.
Switch learned the MAC addresses of PC2 and PC4.
Verify Switch MAC Tables

Used:
Switch> show mac-address-table
Switch 1 showed learned MACs of connected PCs.
Switch 2 showed MACs of its connected PCs.
Clear Switch MAC Tables

Used:
Switch# clear mac-address-table dynamic
Checked again with show mac-address-table → tables were empty.

# Result
ARP resolved IP-to-MAC mappings successfully.
Switches dynamically learned MAC addresses during ping exchanges.
Verified MAC entries using show command.
Cleared the dynamic MAC tables on both switches successfully.

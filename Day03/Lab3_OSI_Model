# Day 2 – Intermediate Networking Lab

# Objective
Use simulation mode to analyze network traffic and observe which OSI layers are involved, and generate Layer 7 traffic by releasing and renewing an IP address.

# Topology
Routers: 2
Switches: 2
PCs: 1
Servers: 1

# Steps

Opened Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer to capture and analyze packets.
Observed traffic between devices and identified OSI layers in use:
Layer 1 (Physical): Transmission of bits across cables.
Layer 2 (Data Link): Ethernet frames for switch communication.
Layer 3 (Network): IP packets handled by routers.
Layer 4 (Transport): TCP/UDP segments during communication.
Layer 7 (Application): Ping (ICMP messages) and DHCP request/response.

Released and renewed PC1’s IP address using the ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew commands.
Captured DHCP traffic in simulation mode:
DHCP Discover (Layer 7 → Application)
DHCP Offer (Server → Client)
DHCP Request (Client → Server)
DHCP Acknowledgment (Server → Client)
Verified that PC1 successfully obtained a new IP address and could again communicate with other devices.

# Result

Simulation mode showed traffic across multiple OSI layers (Physical → Application).
Releasing and renewing PC1’s IP generated visible Layer 7 DHCP traffic, confirming proper address allocation and network connectivity.

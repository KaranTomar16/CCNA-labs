# Day 3 – Basic Device Security 

# Objective
Configure router and switch hostnames, set and secure passwords, test encryption, and save the configuration.

# Topology
Routers: 1 (R1)
Switches: 1 (SW1)
pc: 3

# Steps
1. Change hostnames

Entered global configuration mode.
Used the command:
R1(config)# hostname R1
SW1(config)# hostname SW1
Hostnames successfully changed to R1 and SW1.

2. Configure an unencrypted enable password
Command:
R1(config)# enable password CCNA
SW1(config)# enable password CCNA
Exit back to user EXEC mode and test the password
Exited to user EXEC mode, used enable → prompted for password → entered CCNA → access granted.

3. View the password in the running configuration
Command:
R1# show running-config

Output showed:
enable password CCNA
Password was visible in plain text.

4. Encrypt all passwords
Command:
R1(config)# service password-encryption
This encrypted the existing and future passwords.
View the password in the running configuration
Now CCNA appeared as a scrambled text (Type 7 encryption).

5. Configure a more secure, encrypted enable password
Command:
R1(config)# enable secret Cisco
SW1(config)# enable secret Cisco
Exit back to user EXEC mode and return to privileged EXEC mode
On entering enable, the device asked for a password.
Only Cisco (enable secret) worked, not CCNA.
View the passwords in the running configuration
enable password CCNA → encrypted with Type 7.
enable secret Cisco → encrypted with Type 5 (MD5 hash).

6. Save configuration
Command:
R1# copy running-config startup-config
Configuration saved successfully.

# Result
Hostnames updated for router and switch.
Plain-text password CCNA was encrypted using service password-encryption (Type 7).
Stronger password Cisco set with enable secret (Type 5).
Verified that only the enable secret is used to enter privileged EXEC mode.
Configurations saved to startup-config.
